# # File Handling with Python

# THe key function for working with file in python open() function.
# 
# The open() function takes two parameters; filename nad mod.
# 
# There are four diffrent method (modes) for open file:

# "r" Read-Default value opens a file for reding error if the file does not exist
# 
# "a" Append opens a file for appinging creating the file if it dose not exist
# 
# "W" write Open a file writing creates the file if it does not exist
# 
# "X" Create creates the specified file returns an error if the file exist

# in addition you can specify if the file should be handle as binary or text mode

# "t" Text - Default value Text mode 
# 
# "b" Binary Binary mode

# # Sntax

# To open a file reding it is enough to specify the name of the file:

"""We have a for loop that runs over a range of 10 numbers.
Using the write function to enter data into the file.
The output we want to iterate in the file is "this is line number", which we declare with write function and then percent d (displays integer)
So basically we are putting in the line number that we are writing, then putting it in a carriage return and a new line character"""

# # Python Flie Open

# To open the, use the built-in open() function.

# # Create a New File

# To create a new file in python, use the open() method, with one of the following parameters:
#     
# "x" Create will create a file , returen an error if the file exist
#     
# "a" Append will create a file if the specified file does not exist
# 
# "w" Write will create a file if the specified file does not exist

# In[22]:


f = open("myfile.txt","x")# Result : a new empty file is created!


# In[23]:


#Create a new file it does not exist:

f = open("myfile_1.txt","w")


# # Python Delete file

# To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its OS.removed() function:

# In[24]:


# Remove the file "myfile_1":

import os

os.remove("myfile_1.txt")


# # Check f File exist:

# To avoid getting an error, you might want to check if the exists before you try to delete it:
#     

# In[25]:


import os
if os.path.exists("myfile_1.txt"):
    os.remove("myfile_1")
else:
    print("The file does not exist")


# # Delete Folder

# In[26]:


# Remove the folder"any folder"

import os
os.rmdir("name")
